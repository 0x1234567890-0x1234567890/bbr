 # Summary
The domain _target_ was found to have a CNAME that was pointing to an unregistered domain.

It was possible to register this domain, and to host content on the _target_ website. Given this domain is attributed to _program_(see: attribution) I hosted only a SHA256 string of my researcher account, _researcher).

This can be verified by using the following in the terminal:

```
echo "_username_" | sha256sum
```
Which should present the resulting string:
```
_sha_
```
Which matches what I placed on _target_ for verification.

This has also been stored on the Wayback engine, in case this is resolved before this submission is able to be triaged: _wayback_

# Attribution
A whois of the domain _target_ shows a direct match to other domains relating to _program_, showing this as beloning to _program_:

```
_whois_
```

# Recommendation
Remove the CNAME associated with _target_, or decomission the domain entirely with a redirection to other domains of _program_. If you would like the domain I've claimed to be transferred to you, please don't hestitate to request it within this submission.

# Joke
Triage is a tough gig, here's a joke to lighten the load!
